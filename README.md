# Conductify - Final Year Project 2024
This is the code for my completed FYP - Conductify, a touch-free universal Spotify controller that uses Machine Learning to predict the User's hand gestures which correspond to a specific musical playback control. Conductify directly makes Spotify API calls to the User's account once authentication is successful upon login.
